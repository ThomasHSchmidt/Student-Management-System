# Student-Management-System
Completed in Spring 2024, this project was designed to mimic my university's student management system.

Developed using:
  - AWS SQL Database
  - Python Flask
  - JavaScript
  - HTML
    
This system is capable of allowing users of different permissions to log in, apply for graduation, register for classes, and perform many other student/advisor tasks.
