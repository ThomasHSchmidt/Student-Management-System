# Student-Management-System
Completed in Spring 2024, this project was designed to mimic my university's student management system.

Developed using:
  - AWS SQL Database
  - Python Flask
  - JavaScript
  - HTML
    
This system is capable of allowing users of different permissions to log in, apply for graduation, register for classes, and perform many other student/advisor tasks.

Documentation.md contains a written explanation of the project and each part including some special features that the client had not specifically asked for but were added for better accessibility anyways. This is where you can learn about the software before diving into CodeFile.

CodeFiles contains samples of code from each part of the project, including 2 HTML pages with Cascading Styling Sheet files, functions.py, which contains helper functions that are used in main.py where all our app routes are located. Create.sql contains our database with some sample data that was used to test the system as different users (permissions, role, grades, etc.).
